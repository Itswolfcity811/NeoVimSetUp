# NeoVimSetUp
This is a NeoVim Configuration I made for a client on Fiverr.

To install on Linux/Unix/Mac you need to run the Install.sh script

After you have it installed you need to open NeoVim and run the following commands:
:PlugUpdate to install or update the plugins
:PlugDiff to review the changes from the last update (optional)
:PlugClean to remove plugins no longer in the list (Only run this if you had Vim-plug installed previously)

Package Manager: [Vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) 

File Explorer: [Drex.nvim](https://github.com/TheBlob42/drex.nvim) 

LayTex Support: [Vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) 
If you would like to customize LayTex find documation here: [Readme](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration)
